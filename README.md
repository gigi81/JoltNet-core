Jolt
====

A fork of Jolt.NET : Productivity Libraries for the .NET Framework. The original project can be found at http://jolt.codeplex.com

This fork is based on Jolt.NET v0.4, and differs from the original in the following ways:

* All projects except for the core Jolt project and its unit tests have been stripped out.
* A fix has been applied to issue 8161, and some XML doc comments have been corrected. See http://jolt.codeplex.com/workitem/8161 for details.
* The Jolt binary is now strong-named, so that it can be referenced by other strong-named code.
* The assembly version number is now explicitly stated, rather than incrementing on every build.
